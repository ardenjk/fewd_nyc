      <h1>US</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Each year, Americans waste 33 million tons of food on average; Majority of the cityâ€™s discarded food scraps and yard waste is sent to landfills or incinerators. 
        But when buried at landfills, these organic materials break down and release methane, a very potent global warming gas.
